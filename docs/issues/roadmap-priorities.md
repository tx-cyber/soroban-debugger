# Roadmap Priorities — Epic J

> **Companion to:** [backlog-100-issues.md](backlog-100-issues.md)
>
> **Purpose:** Assign priority, effort, owner area, and dependency notes to every
> backlog issue so maintainers can move from backlog review to delivery planning
> without reclassifying the full set from scratch.
>
> **Done when:** Every issue has a row in this table, and the wave ordering gives
> any contributor a clear first item to pick up.

## Reading the Table

| Column | Values | Meaning |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **P** | P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 | P0 = blocker (ship-gate or broken UX). P1 = high value, do this release cycle. P2 = next cycle. P3 = nice-to-have / deferred. |
| **Effort** | XS / S / M / L / XL | XS ≤ 1 hr · S ≤ half-day · M ≤ 2 days · L ≤ 1 week · XL > 1 week |
| **Owner area** | Docs / DX / Contrib / Release / Meta | The team or role best placed to drive this issue. |
| **Depends on** | Issue IDs or "—" | Issues that should land first, or which provide the foundation for this one. |
| **Wave** | 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 | Delivery wave (see [Wave Plan](#wave-plan) below). |

## Wave Plan

Waves are sequential delivery batches. Each wave is designed to be completeable
in approximately one sprint (two weeks) by a small team focused on docs/process
work. Items within a wave can be parallelised freely.

### Wave 1 — Blockers and Fast Wins (target: ≤ 2 weeks)

**Goal:** Eliminate broken-UX items, missing required files, and quick copy-edits
that unblock everything else. These are the issues that actively embarrass the
project or prevent contributors from starting.

| IDs | Theme |
|-----|-------|
| I-009, I-043 | Incomplete / broken content that misleads readers |
| I-011, I-071 | Missing `CHANGELOG.md` (required by release gate) |
| I-058 | Missing `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (referenced but absent) |
| I-085 | Missing `SECURITY.md` |
| I-094 | `getting-started.md` not linked from README Quick Start |
| I-001, I-002, I-003, I-007, I-008 | README + docs navigation quick-fixes |
| I-023, I-025, I-028 | Broken/missing cross-links in feature docs |
| I-053, I-055, I-057, I-067 | CONTRIBUTING.md copy-edits (no new pages needed) |
| I-060, I-061 | GitHub issue + PR templates |
| I-005, I-083, I-084 | Root-level file housekeeping |
| I-046, I-092 | Fix misplaced / orphaned tutorial and doc index |
| I-088, I-093 | Licence field check; ci.sh vs run_local_ci.sh note |

**Entry criteria for Wave 1:** None — these can start immediately.  
**Exit criteria:** All P0 issues closed; all items in this wave have PRs merged.

---

### Wave 2 — Depth and Process (target: 2–4 weeks after Wave 1)

**Goal:** Fill the substantive content gaps in feature docs, tutorials, and
contributor process that Wave 1 made navigable.

| IDs | Theme |
|-----|-------|
| I-004, I-041 | Config file schema (`.soroban-debug.toml`) |
| I-013–I-022 | Architecture doc expansion |
| I-024, I-033, I-037, I-038, I-045 | Feature reference accuracy fixes |
| I-026–I-032, I-034–I-036 | Plugin, security, storage, batch doc depth |
| I-039, I-042, I-044 | Tutorial content depth |
| I-048, I-066 | VS Code extension setup tutorial + contrib guidance |
| I-020 | Trace schema versioning policy |
| I-027 | Plugin circuit-breaker in-flight event docs |
| I-054, I-056, I-062, I-064, I-065, I-068, I-069 | Contributor process formalization |
| I-072–I-082 | Release operations depth (except I-080) |
| I-086, I-087, I-089–I-091 | Repo meta and DX quick-wins |
| I-097, I-099 | CLI groups cross-links; examples index |

**Entry criteria for Wave 2:** Wave 1 complete; `docs/index.md` (I-007) merged.  
**Exit criteria:** All P1 issues closed; no Wave 2 item older than 3 weeks open.

---

### Wave 3 — Polish and Automation (target: 4–6 weeks after Wave 1)

**Goal:** Convert process knowledge into automation and tooling; close P2 items
that need research or cross-team input.

| IDs | Theme |
|-----|-------|
| I-016, I-040 | Architecture rationale docs |
| I-047, I-049, I-050, I-051, I-052 | Remaining tutorials (plugin, TUI, upgrade-check, REPL, CI remote) |
| I-059, I-063, I-070 | Contributor edge cases (fuzz targets, stale PRs, Windows man-regen) |
| I-078, I-080 | Rollback procedure; release.yml automation |
| I-012 | Badge hardening |
| I-095 | Feature-matrix drift detection |
| I-100 | Dependency upgrade doc process |

**Entry criteria for Wave 3:** Wave 2 complete.  
**Exit criteria:** All P2 issues closed or explicitly deferred to P3 with rationale.

---

### Wave 4 — Continuous Improvement (ongoing / backlog)

**Goal:** Deferred P3 items and long-horizon investments. Pick up opportunistically
or when a related engineering change creates a natural opening.

| IDs | Theme |
|-----|-------|
| I-096 | HTML man-page publishing (GitHub Pages) |
| I-098 | FAQ feedback link |
| Any items demoted from earlier waves with explicit owner + ETA |

---

## Dependency Graph (Key Chains)

The following chains contain the highest-risk blocking relationships. Resolve
blockers within each chain before starting dependants.

```
I-007 (docs index)
  └─► I-006, I-046, I-089, I-092

I-011 (CHANGELOG.md)
  └─► I-071 (git-cliff docs)
        └─► I-062 (CONTRIBUTING reference)

I-015 (VSCode arch doc)
  └─► I-024 (launch.json snippet)
        └─► I-048 (VSCode tutorial)
              └─► I-052 (CI remote tutorial)

I-034 (upgrade classes map)
  └─► I-050 (upgrade-check tutorial)

I-068 (label taxonomy)
  └─► I-054 (issue links in CONTRIBUTING)
  └─► I-074 (release-waiver label)
```

## Owner Area Definitions

| Owner | Who this maps to |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Docs** | Anyone comfortable writing Markdown; no Rust required |
| **DX** | Tooling-oriented contributor; light scripting / CI YAML |
| **Contrib** | Maintainer or senior contributor with process knowledge |
| **Release** | Release manager or designated release owner |
| **Meta** | Any maintainer with repo admin rights (for GitHub settings) |

Issues labelled **Docs** or **DX** in Wave 1 and Wave 2 are ideal `good-first-issue`
candidates for new contributors — they require no Rust knowledge and have clear
acceptance criteria.

---

## Quick-Start for Maintainers

1. **Open Wave 1** — filter this table by `Wave = 1`, sort by `P`, and open
   GitHub issues for each item using the naming convention `[Epic J][I-NNN] <Title>`.
2. **Label** each issue with the tag from the backlog (`DOC`, `CONTRIB`, `RELEASE`,
   etc.) plus the wave label (`wave-1`, `wave-2`, …).
3. **Assign** Docs/DX items without assignees as `good-first-issue` so the
   community can self-select.
4. **Gate Wave 2** on Wave 1 exit criteria — do not open Wave 2 issues until all
   P0 Wave 1 items are merged.
5. **Review this file** at the end of each wave — demote any issues that turn out
   to be lower value than expected, and promote anything the wave work revealed
   as higher priority.
