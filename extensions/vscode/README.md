# Soroban Debugger Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that integrates the Soroban smart contract debugger via the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

## Features

- **Launch Preflight Command**: Validate a Soroban launch configuration from the command palette without starting the backend. If issues are found, the extension offers **direct quick-fixes** that can patch your `launch.json` automatically.

- 🔍 **Breakpoint Management**: Set, clear, and manage breakpoints directly in the VS Code editor
- 📊 **Variable Inspection**: View and inspect contract storage state in the Variables panel
- 📚 **Call Stack Visualization**: Examine the function call stack during execution
- 🧵 **Thread Support**: Basic thread management for debugging sessions
- 📝 **Detailed Logging**: Optional trace logging for debugging adapter interactions
- 📋 **Trace Import & Inspection**: Load and explore saved execution traces from the CLI without starting a live session
- ⚡ **Real-time Debugging**: Step through contract execution with next, step in, and step out
- 📋 **Session Summary**: Get a concise recap of budget totals, events, storage writes, and final status when a session ends

## Privacy & Telemetry

The extension includes **opt-in** failure telemetry to help us improve the tool. No contract data or secrets are ever collected. See [Telemetry Documentation](docs/telemetry.md) for details.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.75.0 or higher
- Node.js 18+ (for extension development)
- `soroban-debug` CLI built from this repository or installed in your PATH
- Rust toolchain with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone the soroban-debugger repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Timi16/soroban-debugger.git
cd soroban-debugger
```

2. Navigate to the extension directory:

```bash
cd extensions/vscode
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Compile the extension:

```bash
npm run compile
```

5. Open VS Code and load the extension:
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
   - Select "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
   - Navigate to the extension directory and select it

### From Marketplace (Coming Soon)

The extension will be published to the VS Code Marketplace. Once available, search for "Soroban Debugger" in the Extensions panel.

## Quick Start

For an end-to-end setup walkthrough, including extension installation, `.vscode/launch.json`, and first breakpoints, see [docs/tutorials/vscode-extension-setup.md](../../docs/tutorials/vscode-extension-setup.md).

### 1. Create a Debug Configuration

Add the following to your project's `.vscode/launch.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Soroban: Debug Contract",
      "type": "soroban",
      "request": "launch",
      "contractPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm",
      "snapshotPath": "${workspaceFolder}/snapshot.json",
      "entrypoint": "main",
      "args": [],
      "trace": false,
      "binaryPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/soroban-debug"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1a. Run Launch Preflight

Before starting a debug session, you can validate the Soroban launch configuration directly from the command palette:

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
2. Run `Soroban: Run Launch Preflight`
3. Pick the Soroban launch configuration you want to validate when prompted

If preflight finds a problem, the extension reports the issue and offers quick fixes. For file-related issues (like missing contracts or binaries), you can **opt-in to patch the configuration directly** after selecting the correct file, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting.

### 1b. Diagnose Source Maps

If your breakpoints are not hitting or appear as "unverified" gray circles, you can diagnose the source mapping for the current file:

1. Open the Rust file where your breakpoints are set.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
3. Search for and run `Soroban: Diagnose Source Maps for Current File`.

This will open an output channel explaining how the debugger heuristically maps your breakpoints to compiled WASM functions, and alert you if a breakpoint is placed outside of a detectable function block.

### 2. Build Your Contract

Ensure your contract is compiled to WASM:

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

### 3. Prepare a Snapshot

Create a `snapshot.json` file with the initial state for your debugger session. See [examples/snapshot.json](../../examples/snapshot.json) for the format.

### 4. Start Debugging

1. Open your contract source code in VS Code
2. Set breakpoints by clicking on the line numbers
3. Select "Soroban: Debug Contract" from the debug configuration dropdown
4. Press F5 or click the Run button to start debugging

## Debug Configuration Options

### Required Parameters

- **contractPath** (string): Path to the compiled WASM contract file
  - Default: `${workspaceFolder}/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm`

### Optional Parameters

- **snapshotPath** (string): Path to the snapshot JSON file containing the initial state
  - Default: `${workspaceFolder}/snapshot.json`

- **entrypoint** (string): The contract function to debug
  - Default: `main`

- **args** (array): Arguments to pass to the contract function
  - Default: `[]`
  - Example: `["arg1", "arg2"]`

- **token** (string): Optional single-line authentication token for the remote debugger server.
  - Tip: When using `request: "launch"`, this token is passed to the spawned server and used for subsequent authentication.

- **tlsCert** (string): Optional path to a TLS certificate file for secure connections.
  - Required if `tlsKey` is provided.

- **tlsKey** (string): Optional path to a TLS private key file for secure connections.
  - Required if `tlsCert` is provided.

- **trace** (boolean): Enable detailed trace logging for debugging the adapter itself
  - Default: `false`

- **binaryPath** (string): Optional path to the `soroban-debug` binary
  - Default: resolved from `${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/soroban-debug`, then PATH

- **requestTimeoutMs** (number): Per-request timeout (wire protocol) before failing the session as unhealthy
  - Default: `30000`
  - Tip: If you’re debugging on a slower machine/CI, increase this.

- **connectTimeoutMs** (number): Timeout to wait for the backend server to accept connections on startup
  - Default: `10000`

- **batchArgs** (string): Path to a JSON file containing an array of argument sets for batch execution. Each entry runs as a separate invocation. Results and a pass/fail summary are printed to the Debug Console.
  - Example: `"${workspaceFolder}/tests/batch_inputs.json"`
  - The JSON file should be an array of arrays, e.g. `[["arg1"], ["arg2", 42], []]`
  - Known limits: batch mode skips breakpoints and stepping; use single-run mode to debug individual failing cases.

### Environment Overrides (Advanced)

If you can’t (or don’t want to) set timeouts in `launch.json`, you can also use:

- `SOROBAN_DEBUG_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`
- `SOROBAN_DEBUG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`

## Usage Guide

### Setting Breakpoints

1. Click on the line number in your source code to set a breakpoint
2. A red dot will appear when the breakpoint is set
3. Breakpoints are managed in the Breakpoints panel on the left sidebar

### Inspecting Variables

When execution is paused:

1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel (Ctrl+Shift+D)
2. Expand the **Variables** section to see contract storage state
3. Hover over variables to see detailed information

#### Large / Nested Values

- Arrays and objects expand lazily and are paginated with an explicit `… show more` entry to avoid freezing the UI.
- Long string values are truncated with a `(truncated, expand)` hint; expanding reveals the full value.
- Typed argument annotations like `{"type":"bytes","value":"0x..."}` render as `bytes(n)` previews; expanding shows hex/base64/utf8 details.

#### Searching and Paging Large Storage

For contracts with many storage keys, you can search and page through storage entries in the **Debug Console** (when paused):

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `storage.search <query>` | Filter storage entries by key or value substring (case-insensitive). Returns matching entries with expandable details. |
| `storage.page <N>` | View page N of storage entries (1-based). Entries are sorted alphabetically and served in configurable page sizes. |
| `storage.count` | Display the total number of storage entries. |
| `storage.<key>` | Retrieve the value of a specific storage key. |

Example usage in the Debug Console:
```
storage.count
→ 1250 storage entries

storage.search balance
→ Found 3 match(es)

storage.page 5
→ Page 5/13 (1250 total entries)
```

### Using the Call Stack

The **Call Stack** panel shows:

- Current function being executed
- Parent function context
- Line and column information
- Click any frame to jump to that location in your code

### Step Controls

Use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- **F10** or **Step Over**: Execute the next line without stepping into functions
- **F11** or **Step In**: Step into the next function call
- **Shift+F11** or **Step Out**: Continue execution until the current function returns
- **F5** or **Continue**: Resume execution until the next breakpoint
- **Shift+F5** or **Stop**: Terminate the debugging session

## Feature Limitations

The VS Code extension exposes a focused subset of the full `soroban-debug` CLI.
The following features are **not available** in the extension.

## Attach Mode (Remote Debugging)

The extension supports attaching to an already-running `soroban-debug server` process, whether it is local or on a remote host.

### Starting the server (CLI)

```bash
soroban-debug server \
  --port 2345 \
  --token my-secret-token
```

### Attach configuration (`launch.json`)

```json
{
  "name": "Soroban: Attach to Remote Debugger",
  "type": "soroban",
  "request": "attach",
  "host": "192.168.1.10",
  "port": 2345,
  "contractPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm",
  "entrypoint": "main",
  "args": [],
  "token": "my-secret-token"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | No (default `127.0.0.1`) | Hostname or IP of the running server |
| `port` | Yes | TCP port the server is listening on |
| `contractPath` | Yes | Path to the contract WASM on the local machine |
| `token` | No | Auth token if the server was started with `--token` |
| `connectTimeoutMs` | No | How long to wait for the server to respond (default 10 000 ms) |

> Security note: when connecting over a non-loopback network, run the server behind an SSH tunnel or a VPN. The wire protocol does not include TLS.

---

## Advanced Configuration

### Timeouts

To avoid “frozen” sessions when the backend stalls, the extension enforces deterministic timeouts for every backend request.

You can configure timeouts in either place:

- VS Code Settings: `soroban-debugger.requestTimeoutMs`, `soroban-debugger.connectTimeoutMs`
- `launch.json`: `requestTimeoutMs`, `connectTimeoutMs` (overrides settings)

### Remote Troubleshooting Matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to try |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session never attaches | Backend startup is slow, wrong `binaryPath`, wrong port, or loopback networking is blocked | Increase `connectTimeoutMs`, verify `binaryPath`, and try `127.0.0.1` if `localhost` behaves differently in your environment. |
| Variables/stack requests time out after attach | Backend is alive, but request timeout is too low for inspection traffic | Increase `requestTimeoutMs` in `launch.json` or settings. |
| Authentication failure in logs | Server token and client launch settings disagree | Verify the same token is configured on both sides if you are launching against an authenticated server. |
| Protocol mismatch / unknown response | Extension and CLI come from different builds or release lines | Update the extension and `soroban-debug` binary together. |
| Repeated reconnect/disconnect behavior | Unstable loopback path, server crash, or backend health issue | Turn on `"trace": true`, inspect the "Soroban Debugger" output channel, and compare against the CLI troubleshooting guide. |

For the full CLI + VS Code matrix, see [docs/remote-troubleshooting.md](../../docs/remote-troubleshooting.md).

### Event Capture and Filters

To stream contract events into the Debug Console, enable `showEvents`. You can optionally add
`eventFilter` entries to reduce noise. Filters are case-insensitive substrings by default, or
regex patterns when prefixed with `re:`.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Soroban: Debug Contract",
  "type": "soroban",
  "request": "launch",
  "contractPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm",
  "entrypoint": "main",
  "args": [],
  "showEvents": true,
  "eventFilter": ["transfer", "re:^fn_.*"],
  "binaryPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/debug/soroban-debug"
}
```

Events appear in the Debug Console with an `[event]` prefix.

### Cross-Contract Mocking

Use `mock` to stub cross-contract calls with deterministic return values. Each entry is
`CONTRACT_ID.function=return_value`.

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Soroban: Debug Contract",
  "type": "soroban",
  "request": "launch",
  "contractPath": "${workspaceFolder}/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/contract.wasm",
  "entrypoint": "main",
  "args": [],
  "mock": [
    "CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.transfer=123",
    "CBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.balance={\"type\":\"i64\",\"value\":\"42\"}"
  ]
}
```

### Debugging the Extension Itself

To debug the extension code:

1. Open the extension folder in VS Code
2. Press F5 to launch the Extension Development Host
3. A new VS Code window opens with the extension loaded
4. Set breakpoints in the extension source code (TypeScript files in `src/`)

### Enabling Trace Logging

For troubleshooting the Debug Adapter Protocol communication:

```json
{
  "name": "Debug with Trace",
  "type": "soroban",
  "request": "launch",
  "contractPath": "...",
  "trace": true
}
```

Trace output appears in the Debug Console (Ctrl+Shift+U).

### Session Summary

When a debug session concludes, the extension presents a concise final summary. This helps you quickly recap the execution without manually combing through logs. The summary includes:

- **Final status** (Success, Failure, Panic)
- **Budget totals** (CPU instructions and Memory consumed)
- **Event count**
- **Storage writes**
- **Exported artifact paths** (e.g., traces, storage snapshots)

### Diagnostic Logging

The extension now maintains persistent, structured logs for all debug sessions. These are invaluable for diagnosing environment-specific failures or backend crashes.

- **Real-time logs**: View the "Soroban Debugger" output channel in the Output panel.
- **Persistent logs**: Session logs are stored in the extension's global storage directory and rotated when they reach 10MB.
- **Phased tracking**: Logs are categorized into phases such as `Spawn`, `Connect`, `Auth`, `Load`, and `Execution`.
- **Privacy**: Authentication tokens are automatically redacted from all log files.

## Architecture

The extension consists of three main components:

### Extension Host (extension.ts)

- Initializes the extension
- Registers the debug adapter factory
- Manages extension lifecycle

### Debug Adapter (src/dap/adapter.ts)

- Implements the Debug Adapter Protocol
- Handles breakpoints, stepping, and variable inspection
- Manages debug session state

### CLI Process Wrapper (src/cli/debuggerProcess.ts)

- Spawns the `soroban-debug server` process
- Connects to the remote debug protocol over TCP
- Handles process lifecycle and request/response transport

### Protocol Types (src/dap/protocol.ts)

- TypeScript types for DAP events and commands
- Debugger state management
- Variable reference handling

## Troubleshooting

### Protocol, timeout, and auth issues

- Start with the matrix above and the dedicated [remote troubleshooting guide](../../docs/remote-troubleshooting.md).
- If startup hangs, adjust `connectTimeoutMs` before `requestTimeoutMs`.
- If the session starts but pause-state fetches fail, adjust `requestTimeoutMs`.
- If logs mention protocol incompatibility, update the extension and CLI together rather than only raising timeouts.
- If logs mention auth rejection, fix the token mismatch before retrying.

### Extension doesn't activate

- Verify VS Code is version 1.75.0 or higher: `Help > About`
- Check that the extension is properly installed in `~/.vscode/extensions/`

### Debugger fails to start

- Ensure the `soroban-debug` CLI is in your PATH, or set `binaryPath`
- Verify contract path points to a valid WASM file
- Check that snapshot.json exists and is valid JSON
- Run `Soroban: Run Launch Preflight` from the command palette to catch launch configuration issues before starting a session

### Breakpoints not working

- Confirm breakpoints are set before starting the debug session
- Check Debug Console for any error messages
- Try enabling trace logging for more details

### Low performance during debugging

- Large snapshot files can slow down initialization
- Consider using a minimal snapshot for testing
- Disable trace logging if enabled

---

## Manifest Schema Validation

`extensions/vscode/package.schema.json` provides an offline, strict JSON Schema (draft-07) that validates the shape of `package.json` for this extension.

### Why this exists

VS Code normally validates extension manifests against a network-fetched schema. In offline environments, CI sandboxes, or air-gapped machines that schema fetch silently fails, leaving `package.json` unvalidated. The local schema closes that gap: unknown top-level keys, mistyped settings, and malformed launch-config attribute trees are all rejected at authoring time rather than silently drifting.

### What is validated

| Area | Validated fields |
|------|------------------|
| **Top-level manifest** | `name`, `version` (semver), `engines.vscode`, `main`, `contributes` — unknown keys rejected |
| **contributes.commands** | `command` and `title` required; unknown keys rejected |
| **contributes.configuration** | `soroban-debugger.requestTimeoutMs` and `soroban-debugger.connectTimeoutMs` shape and types |
| **contributes.debuggers** | `type` must be `"soroban"`; both `launch` and `attach` attribute trees validated |
| **Launch config attributes** | All supported fields: `contractPath`, `entrypoint`, `args`, `port` (1–65535), `token`, `tlsCert`/`tlsKey`, `storageFilter`, `repeat`, `batchArgs`, `requestTimeoutMs`, `connectTimeoutMs`, `dryRun` |
| **Attach config attributes** | `host`, `port`, and all shared optional fields |
| **initialConfigurations / configurationSnippets** | `name`, `type: "soroban"`, `request: "launch" \| "attach"` required; unknown body keys rejected |

### How to validate locally

Using `ajv-cli`:

```bash
npm install -g ajv-cli

# Validate package.json against the local schema
ajv validate \
  -s extensions/vscode/package.schema.json \
  -d extensions/vscode/package.json \
  --spec=draft7 \
  --strict=false
```

A passing run prints:
```
extensions/vscode/package.json valid
```

Any violation prints the JSON path and error message, e.g.:
```
extensions/vscode/package.json invalid
[
  {
    "instancePath": "/contributes/debuggers/0/type",
    "message": "must be equal to constant"
  }
]
```

### Integrating into CI

Add a validation step before the compile step in your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/extension.yml (example)
- name: Validate extension manifest schema
  run: |
    npm install -g ajv-cli
    ajv validate \
      -s extensions/vscode/package.schema.json \
      -d extensions/vscode/package.json \
      --spec=draft7 \
      --strict=false
```

The `make ci-local` target already runs this check. For sandbox CI use `make ci-sandbox`, which skips network-dependent steps but still runs schema validation.

### Updating the schema

When you add a new launch/attach config field to `package.json`, you must also add it to `package.schema.json` or the manifest validation step will fail.

| What you're adding | Where to add it in the schema |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| New launch attribute | `definitions.launchConfig.properties.properties` |
| New attach attribute | `definitions.attachConfig.properties.properties` |
| New VS Code setting | `contributes.configuration.properties` |
| New command | No schema change needed (commands validate `command`+`title` only) |

Use the existing `$ref` helper definitions (`stringProp`, `boolProp`, `portProp`, `timeoutProp`, etc.) for common patterns to keep the schema consistent.

### Constraints and known limitations

- The schema is draft-07 to match the `$schema` declaration already in `package.json`.
- `configurationAttributes.launch.properties` and `.attach.properties` use `additionalProperties: false` — any field not listed in `definitions.launchConfig` / `definitions.attachConfig` will cause a validation error.
- The `anyDebugConfig` definition (used for `initialConfigurations` and snippet body objects) is also strict; keep it in sync when adding new fields.
- The schema does not validate `contributes.debuggers[].program` or `runtime` against actual file paths — those are checked at runtime by VS Code.

## Development

### Build and Test

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Watch for changes
npm run watch

# Run tests
npm test

# Package for distribution
npm run vscode:prepublish
```

### Developer Workflow (Local CI)

Before opening a pull request, you must ensure your code passes all continuous integration (CI) gates. To make this easy, we have bundled all formatting, linting, and testing into a single command.

Run this from the root of the repository:
```bash
make ci-local

### Running Tests

- `npm test` runs the smoke suite and the DAP end-to-end suite sequentially.
- `npm run test:smoke` runs the smoke checks only.
- `npm run test:dap-e2e` runs the DAP adapter end-to-end suite only.
